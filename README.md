# SimpliciText

A minimal text editor

The core idea of this text editor is to use your keyboard, not mouse. Everything you can do with your mouse can be done with shortcuts, in a more practical way. You'll be so attached that you'll even forget you have a mouse in the first place!

Everything is well thought and integrated, all in a minimal yet powerful environment.

Doesn't need an internet connection to run. The only time you'll need one is when a new update will be available

Here, `Ctrl + Alt` is your best friend! There are some exceptions but the majority of shortcuts use this key combination as a base. Featuring:
- `Ctrl + Alt + L / D` changes the visual for a light (L) or dark (D) mode.
- `Ctrl + Alt + T` (off by default) makes the window stay on top, even if you click on another window.
- `Ctrl + Alt + S` a toggle shortcut to show alternative stats in the bottom right.
- `Ctrl + Alt + H` feeling lost? This will show a help page with everything you need to know.
- `Ctrl + Alt + Up / Down / Left / Right` can look confusing but really isn't. Split the editor in the direction of your choice to have a quick look at your Markdown text.

Some other notable features which doesn't quite use the same shortcuts are:
- __**Markdown**__ support! Use the arrow keys shortcut to preview it.
- **Simple leave** lets you hold your escape key to leave the editor. Nice and clean.
- **Auto save**! No need to think about saving your file anymore, it does it for you!





Enjoy :)
