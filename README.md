## SimpliciText?
It can be described as a fully-featured, yet minimal and lightweight text editor (not code editor!).

It's most useful to take quick notes, so think of it as an alternative to TextEdit rather than Notepad++. Better looking, more practical, weight only a few MBs, no reason not to try it!
