A minimal text editor

Here, `Ctrl + Alt` is your best friend! There are some exceptions but the majority of shortcuts use this key combination as a base. Featuring:
- **Auto save**! No need to think about saving your file anymore, it does it for you!
- `Ctrl + Alt + L / D` changes the visual for a light (L) or dark (D) mode.
- `Ctrl + Alt + T` (off by default) makes the window stay on top, even if you click on another window.
- `Ctrl + Alt + S` a toggle shortcut to show alternative stats in the bottom right.
