## What
**SimpliciText** can be described as a powerful, minimal text editor.

## Why
I simply wanted to make this my first project, but got far enough to feel like sharing it with everyone.  
It also familiarizes you with shortcuts, as you don't ever need your mouse to do anything!

## How
Here, `Ctrl + Alt` is your best friend! These two keys are the base of every shortcut. Featuring:
- `Ctrl + Alt + L / D` changes the visual for a light (L) or dark (D) mode.
- `Ctrl + Alt + T` (off by default) makes the window stay on top, even if you click on another window.
- `Ctrl + Alt + 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 0` switches to another tab, with a grand total of 10 different opened tabs at the same time!
- `Ctrl + Alt + S` a toggle shortcut to show alternative stats in the bottom right.
~~- `Ctrl + Alt + H` feeling lost? This will show a help page with everything you need to know~~ (not yet implemented).
- `Ctrl + Alt + Up / Down / Left / Right` can look confusing but really isn't. Split the editor in the direction of your choice to have a quick look at your Markdown text.
- `Ctrl + Alt + - / +` lets you enlarge or reduce the text, as simple as that.
  - `Ctrl + Alt + =` the little brother, resets the text size.

Some other notable are:
- **Markdown** support! Use the arrow keys shortcut to preview it.
- **Simple leave** lets you hold your escape key for a few seconds to leave the editor. ~~Nice and clean~~ (not yet nice and clean).
- **Auto save**! No need to think about saving your file anymore, it does it for you!

Enjoy :)
